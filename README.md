UPI Transaction Analysis
UPI Transaction Analysis is a comprehensive Power BI project that provides in-depth insights into Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transaction data. The project leverages robust data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques to present actionable insights on transaction patterns, user behavior, and geographic distribution.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze various attributes of UPI transactions, including:

Transaction volumes and values over time

Distribution of transactions by payment type (e.g., Person-to-Merchant, Person-to-Person)

Geographic distribution of transactions

Top transacting entities (e.g., banks, merchants)

Identification of peak transaction periods

The insights derived aim to empower stakeholders with a clearer understanding of UPI ecosystem dynamics and trends.

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Data Source: Raw UPI transaction data (e.g., CSV, Excel)

Key Cleaning Steps:

Handling missing values in critical columns (e.g., transaction amount, date, status).

Standardizing date and time formats.

Removing duplicate entries.

Transforming data types for optimal analysis in Power BI.

Creating derived columns (e.g., transaction month, day of week) for enhanced analysis.

ðŸ“ˆ Data Modeling & Visualization

Power BI Data Model:

Established relationships between relevant tables (e.g., transactions, merchants, users if separate).

Created calculated columns and measures using DAX to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total transaction value, average transaction amount, and growth rates.

Interactive Dashboards: Developed a user-friendly and interactive Power BI dashboard featuring:

Overview Page: High-level summaries of total transactions, values, and key trends.

Time Series Analysis: Visualizations showing transaction trends by day, week, and month.

Geographic Distribution: Maps illustrating transaction density across regions/states.

Payment Type Breakdown: Charts detailing the distribution of transactions by various UPI payment categories.

Top Entities: Rankings of top banks, merchants, or users by transaction volume and value.

ðŸ’¡ Key Findings & Visualizations

During the analysis in Power BI, the following key insights and visualizations were developed:

Remaining Balance by Customer Age: A visual representation (e.g., bar chart or line chart) showing the aggregated remaining balance of customers, segmented by their age groups. This helps in understanding the financial behavior and liquidity across different demographics.

Transaction Amount Over Time: Detailed analysis of the sum of transaction amounts, broken down by:

Week: Identifying weekly transaction patterns and fluctuations.

Day: Highlighting daily peaks and troughs in transaction activity.

Month: Observing long-term monthly trends and seasonal variations.

Matrix Representation of Key Values: A comprehensive matrix table displaying various aggregated values (e.g., total transactions, average amount, unique users) against different dimensions (e.g., payment type, location, merchant category). This provides a detailed, cross-sectional view of the data.
