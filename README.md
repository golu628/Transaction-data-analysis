📊 Project Overview

UPI Transaction Analysis is a comprehensive Power BI project that delivers in-depth insights into the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) ecosystem.
It leverages data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to uncover transaction patterns, user behavior, and geographic distribution.

🔎 The project focuses on:
✔️ Transaction volumes & values over time
✔️ Distribution by payment type (P2M, P2P, etc.)
